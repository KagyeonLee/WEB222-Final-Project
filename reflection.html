                    <p>Responsive design is closely related to web technologies. Each people are having own devices which are different screen size. Which mean, if web site allows only single layout size, it definitely leads to uncomfortable when the user using this web site. User friendly design is most important part in developing web sites. If the image in some layouts should became squished and illegible, then nobody wants to visit this website. When the develop web sites, programmer should consider the user experience design.  Most of screen resolutions are accommodated web site is compatibly. And it makes user more comfortable to using web sites.</p>

                    <p>At first, I chose the mobile screen size such as iPhone 6/7/8 plus. I worked for fitting this resolution and I declared the width size within this resolution. And I designed the navigation for responsive design, it is hiding when the user visits this site on small screen as different web site. When the user touch or click the menu button, I will drop down and shows the menu smoothly. Also, I designed the thumbnails to fit the mobile screen, it shows only two items on one line. <br>I considered fonts, image, or other elements for this screen size.</p>

                    <p>I have learned that if I could not consider image or any elements size, then it must not fit mobile screen size. I tried to arrange these elements one by one, but I realized that the small image or one image might waste many spaces unnecessarily on mobile resolution. For example, mobile image has to be shown larger than desktop image size.  Because when switch the web site to web app, existing images will display much smaller through mobile device on small screen. As well, each elements size should consider based on device’s resolution.</p>
